Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applicationsâ€” automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.

In our vagrant file the acs is used as ansible master where ansible is intalled and the other two db and webserver are used as nodes that can be used for example
The acs VM is using ubuntu version 14.04.6 LTS

To install ansible (https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-install-and-configure-latest-version-of-ansible-on-ubuntu-linux/):
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ $ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install ansible

Add other hosts 
$ sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts   Or   $ vi $HOME/hosts

e.g.,
[webservers]
server1.cyberciti.biz
104.20.187.5
104.20.186.5

[devservers]
10.98.222.4
10.98.222.7
10.98.222.8

Generate public key on acs to talk to remote systems
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "My ansisble key" (HINT: KEEP PRESSING ENTER TO SELECT DEFAULT VALUES)

copy key into remote systems
$ ssh-copy-id -i /home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa.pub vagrant@192.168.33.30
$ ssh-copy-id -i /home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa.pub vagrant@192.168.33.20

send ping request to all servers
$ ansible -i ~/hosts -m ping all
 
find out uptime of all hosts
$ ansible -i ~/hosts -m shell -a 'uptime' all
-i - specify inventory host path
-m - module name of ansible to be used
-a - module arguments
all - means all hosts
